Inspiration for the Game:
Back in India, when I was a child, this was one of the most popular games we played with friends and cousins, especially when we gathered at our granny’s house during the summer holidays. At that time, we used game-printed on the paper sheets to play, because technology wasn’t as developed as it is today.

Later, the game became available digitally, but I never got the chance or time to download or play it again. Now, I finally have the chance to build this game myself and the best part is, I can do it without writing a single line of code!

This game has always felt special to me because, in many ways, it’s like life itself — full of snakes and ladders. Sometimes we climb up with unexpected opportunities, and sometimes we slide down when challenges come our way. But no matter what, we keep rolling the dice and moving forward.

Instructions to Play this Game:
Curious to know how to play this classic game? Here’s how it works — it’s simple, fun, and full of surprises!

🎮 Goal:
Be the first player to reach square 100 on the board.

🎮 How to Move:
Roll the dice on your turn.
Move your token forward by the number you roll.

🎮 Ladders:
Land at the bottom of a ladder? Lucky you — climb up to the top and get ahead!

🎮 Snakes:
Oops! Land on a snake’s head and you’ll have to slide all the way down to its tail.

🎮 Time:
Each player has 45 seconds to roll the dice on their turn. If you don’t roll within that time, your chance will automatically be passed on to the next player — so stay sharp and roll quick!

🎮 Bonus Turn:
Roll a 6 and you get another chance to roll — keep that streak going!

Build the Game with Amazon Q CLI:
I was introduced to Amazon Q CLI by Onur Dogruoz at a AWS Build Games Meetup in NYC and I couldn’t wait to try it out. Amazon Q CLI makes building and experimenting with ideas incredibly easy, even if you don’t want to write a single line of code.

With just a few commands/prompts, I was able to generate the basic structure for my Snakes & Ladders game. From setting up the logic for dice rolls to adding conditions for ladders and snakes, Amazon Q CLI handled it all. It’s like having an AI-powered coding assistant right at our fingertips.

What’s so cool about Amazon Q CLI?
🐍 It lets you describe what we want in natural language and generates the code for us in any programming language.

🪜 It saves so much time and lowers the barrier for anyone who wants to build something fun — whether you’re a developer or just curious to see your ideas come alive.

If you’ve ever dreamed of turning an idea into reality without getting stuck on complex coding, this is your sign to give it a try!

So go ahead — roll the dice, experiment with your own projects, and see what you can create with Amazon Q CLI. Happy building! 🎉
